      your ideas to reality.

      - title: Crafting your brand identity
        content: >
          I work closely with my clients to build strong, recgonisable and
          versatile branding packages for their businesses which include logos,
          marketing material and documentation. 
      - title: Advertising and promotional imagery
        content: >
          I deploy a market-oriented approach to advertising material that
          connects with customers and enables your brand to be visible,
          relatable and contemporary.
      - title: Bespoke clothing - from ideas to reality
        content: >
          Having run my own clothing brand, I've established a network of
          suppliers, printers, embroiders and manufacturers that allow me to
          design your uniforms and custom clothing and bring them into reality. 
      - title: Product packaging and physical media
        content: >
          Packaging requires design with a real world focus; what good is a
          virtual mockup if it falls apart in reality? I've worked with dozens
          of satisfied clients to make sachets, boxes, bottles and more.
