I am an
experienced, self-taught freelance Graphic and UX designer based in Auckland,
New Zealand. I’m studying my Honours in Mechanical Engineering at the University
of Auckland and work closely with my clients to provide branding and design
solutions in my spare time.   

> The world always seems brighter when you’ve just made something that wasn’t there before. - Neil Gaiman

It all started seven
years ago, where at the tender age of fourteen I first decided to download GIMP
and made my first piece of art out of pure boredom. Fast forward two and a half
years to the day I took my first ever client and made a custom YouTube banner
for a modest $5. These two foundational moments are solely responsible for my
two most overwhelming passions – design and business. After taking on hundreds
of clients and running my own clothing brand, I can happily say that those
humble beginnings allowed me to become the person I am now.

I have a very
client-centric approach to my design philosophy, wherein the customer’s
satisfaction is always my first priority. It is important for me to meet my
clients face-to-face (or online) and understand the vision they have so that I
can use my skillset to bring that vision to life.
